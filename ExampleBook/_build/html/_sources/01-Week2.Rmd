# Adding in images and tables.

In this week's notes we will look at adding images and basic tables. You can also add a link to the [notes last week][Introduction] by referring to the name of the heading.

## Example of a table

Here is a basic table.

|Header 1| Header 2 | Header 3|
|:------|:-------|:---------|
|Row 1 | Number | Number|
|Row 2 | Number | Number|

## Adding images

We look at two approaches for adding the same image. We add **alternative text** in both cases. You will see how R Markdown treats them differently.

:::remark
The files must be in the same directory as this 01-Week2.Rmd file.
:::

### Approach 1

This is the easier approach but the alternative text is not as nice.

![Here is the alternative text](workers.png)

### Approach 2

This is the slightly more difficult approach and requires the use of R, but it is better for "hiding" the alternative text.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.alt="Here is the alternative text"}
knitr::include_graphics("workers.png")

```

## Adding in images using R (or Python)

Press ctrl, alt and i to add R code This adds the chunk below and you can add in R code. Python etc. can also be added by pressing the '+C' image at the top right corner.

As an example please see the following.

```{r,fig.alt="A graph that shows...", fig.cap="A graph demonstrating..."}
x<-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)
y<-x^{2}
plot(x,y,lwd=4,main="Mock plot")

```
<br>


You can also hide code, so that graphs are produced without showing the code, or you can hide output so the code is shown without the results etc. see [the R Markdown cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for more information.

Here is one example where the graph is produced but the output is hidden, by setting echo=FALSE.

```{r,fig.alt="A graph that shows...", fig.cap="A graph demonstrating...",echo=FALSE}
x<-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)
y<-x^{2}
plot(x,y,lwd=4,main="Mock plot")

```
<br>

Here is another example where the code is shown but the graph is not shown using eval=FALSE.

```{r,fig.alt="A graph that shows...", fig.cap="A graph demonstrating...",eval=FALSE}
x<-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)
y<-x^{2}
plot(x,y,lwd=4,main="Mock plot")

```
